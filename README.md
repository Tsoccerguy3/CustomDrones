# CustomDrones

The CustomDrones mod of Minecraft that @WilliamEz has made before. (Original Forum Site: https://goo.gl/6ZqBMg)

## Declaration

I am not here to steal his work. I want to help him to maintain the project. I will abusolutely keep HIS NAME inside the repo and the mod info, and HIS COMPLETED WORK (I will change some if I find bugs or so).
If he finally come back and wish to work the project alone continually, WilliamEz is welcome to do.
Whether you are a user or a programmer, feel free to  provide the idea you have and point my mistake.

## Development

Prepare a MDK and Java8 environment is just enough.
Feel free to pull request.
    
The development branch is [dev-1.10.2](https://github.com/nekomeowww/CustomDrones/tree/dev-1.10.2).    
```
#Use Git Clone to create a git repo on your local device.
git clone -b dev-1.10.2 https://github.com/nekomeowww/CustomDrones.git
```
The development branch has the highest priority of updating info, and code; if you wish to check the progress out, just you ahead to the [dev branch](https://github.com/nekomeowww/CustomDrones/tree/dev-1.10.2).


## Plan and Progress

### Plan

The current plan was make this work on ```forge-1.10.2-12.18.3.2221``` runtime environment. Even support up to ```forge-1.12 - 14.21.1.2387```. I may transfer this repo to a organization which called "CustomDrones".
As for the future plan, I would like to consider to contact the original creator.

### Progress

I am now trying to take notes on the source code which I just pushed [here](https://github.com/nekomeowww/CustomDrones/commit/2816a9458a14c2ad9f0d45bfde1becbde07ef37d).
In order to migrate all the code from his source and pack it with my code style, this may take upto a week or less (if my current plan is right).

## Translation of Wiki

I am Chinese, I did started to work on the Wiki translation before I finally decided to work the repo.
So the current Wiki page on the [CustomDrones-Wiki](https://github.com/nekomeowww/CustomDrones-Wiki) declared that the language is Chinese. If you are Chinese and wish to help translate everything (include item names, the description, the block, etc.), leave an issue [here](https://github.com/nekomeowww/CustomDrones-Wiki/issues).    
For the other languages, leave an issue in the [Issue](https://github.com/nekomeowww/CustomDrones-Wiki/issues) tab and mark your language like this:     
__[Your Language (Must be English)] Wiki(Two options, Wiki or Project) Localization__.     
For example, if you wish to request a project localization of Dutch, you issue title should be:    
__[Dutch] Project Localization__,    
if you wish to work on wiki, your title should be:    
__[Ducth] Wiki Localization__.   

If you are interested in building a new Wiki Page project, we may need to discuss it for detailed info(I had some ideas before).
